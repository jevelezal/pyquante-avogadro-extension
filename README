GlWrapper: 

isosurface method that takes a function and generates all the useful

TODO: need also to display directly volumetric data

=== Distributing ===

* proposing a global "lib" directory in avogadro
* using a pyquante directory where to pack all the stuff and suggest to do so

== Tasks ==

TODO: Writing a NICE GUI for the pyquante extension
